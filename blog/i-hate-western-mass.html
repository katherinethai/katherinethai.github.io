      <h5>Mar 23, 2022</h5>
      <p>At least once every day, I am walking my dog in rural/suburban Western Massachusetts and I think, "All my friends are in New York City making plans to go out right now."
      <br><br>
       I was recently thinking about how to "sell" UMass Amherst to the prospective PhD student. We did our candidate visit day online (excruciating), so no one could see for themselves what it's like to live in Amherst.
       Not that being in person would have helped; prospective PhD students have definitely come in person and ended up disliking Amherst enough to sway their decisions to attend UMass.

       There are many things I hate about living here, and here are the main ones:</p>
       <ol>
         <li>You'll probably need a car.</li>
         <p>When I visited UMass as a prospective PhD student, someone told me that the difference between a happy student and a miserable, depressed grad student was a car. People will tell you that you can get away with biking or public transportation, but biking isn't feasible in the winter,
         and public transportation options get worse and worse the further you live from campus. Also if you live close to enough to campus to walk, you definitely have to drive to the nearest grocery store AND you probably live next to undergrads who are busy getting impaled on fences.</p>
         <li>The weather sucks.</li>
         <p>In undergrad, I read <i>Ethan Frome</i> and spent a class discussing the significance of the name of fictional town Starkfield, MA.
          This is Starkfield, MA. The days are short, it's so cold, and a smash-up would probably be the most exciting thing to happen here in years. The summers are unbearably hot, humid, and bug-infested. During the spring and fall when temparatures are bearable (pleasant, even),
          you will find me being held together by all the over-the-counter antihistamines money can buy.</p>
         <li>The neighborhood vibes are not great.</li>
         <p>In the 9 months that I've lived here I have (a) seen a Confederate flag license plate in my neighborhood, (b) heard my boyfriend be confronted by a woman who said he "didn't look like he lived here" in the yard of the house <i>that he owns</i>,
         (c) received an anonymous letter from a neighbor complaining about us storing our recycling bins in front of our house, and (d) been accused of leaving empty mini bottles of alcohol everywhere (so many flavored vodkas. . .is this person okay??).</p>
         <li>It's so boring.</li>
         <p>Almost nothing is open late and sometimes I walk to the 7/11 on my street just to feel alive (I miss Wawa).</p>
       </ol>
       <p>If I actually wanted to sell you on Amherst-the-area, I'd do some point-by-point rebuttal of the things I hate about living here and spin them into contrived positives (There's so little to do here that I spend all my time working on my research!).
        Instead, I'm going to write about the things that make living here bearable, and tell you why I don't regret coming here even if I don't like it. In no particular order: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>It's cheap.</li>
          <p>The cost of living out here (especially rent) is so low that I have money to do things that make life worth living: having a dog, living in a place big enough to host guests, leaving Western Mass.</p>
          <li>My friends visit. A LOT.</li>
          <p>In the twelve months that I've lived in Massachusetts, the same college friends have visited 4 separate times. For my birthday, 8 of my friends traveled over 3 hours to stay with me for a weekend. Friends attending graduate programs in California
          and Pennsylvania have come to visit. It's not hard to sell a little trip out to rural Massachusetts to my friends who live in the city, plus I have the luxury of two guest bedrooms for them to stay in.</p>
          <li>Excellent research fit and advisor compatibility.</li>
          <p>So research fit alone probably could have convinced me to come here: I get to work with literary data AND humanities professors. That's all undergrad me every hoped for. But also, my advisor has great vibes. We have compatible work styles aka I don't get judged
          for submitting something at 4am that I started at 3:30am. He doesn't care if I (encourages me to?) skip class. We share trivial priorities like having snacks at lab meeting. I had an unfortunate experience TAing for another faculty member and he supported me
          throughout the resolution process. I got an urgent call from doggy daycare that my dog needed to be picked up right away, and he let me bring her to school. My morale is high because I'm not wasting time constantly trying to justify why I'm doing what I'm doing. <br>
          My point is not that you should come to UMass Amherst to work with my advisor, but rather that </p>
          <li>My boyfriend, among many other things, cooks dinner for me, and is fully aware that I plan to get the hell out of here ASAP.</li>
          <p>Throughout my entire academic career, exercising has been the one thing that can ease my stress. A couple evenings a week, I'm at a small gym taking fitness classes until late evening, so my boyfriend will often cook dinner for me so I still have time to take the dog out and work before bed.
          A non-negligible amount of my stress is from living in a place I hate, so anything that allows me to mitigate that stress is great. My boyfriend and I are in agreement that we are leaving Western Mass as soon as my PhD is done. We have different city preferences (him Boston or DC, me NYC), but
          my only requirement is that I won't need a car. I should also probably mention that I never would have met my boyfriend if I hadn't come to UMass.</p>
